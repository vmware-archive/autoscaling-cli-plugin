*	This function must be implemented as part of the	plugin interface
*	defined by the core CLI.
*
*	GetMetadata() returns a PluginMetadata struct. The first field, Name,
*	determines the name of the plugin which should generally be without spaces.
*	If there are spaces in the name a user will need to properly quote the name
*	during uninstall otherwise the name will be treated as seperate arguments.
*	The second value is a slice of Command structs. Our slice only contains one
*	Command Struct, but could contain any number of them. The first field Name
*	defines the command `cf basic-plugin-command` once installed into the CLI. The
*	second field, HelpText, is used by the core CLI to display help information
*	to the user in the core commands `cf help`, `cf`, or `cf -h`.
